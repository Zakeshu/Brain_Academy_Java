/**
 * Created by a.zemlyanskiy on 05.09.2016.
 * Open project called  TestException.
 *
 * 1) Create your own exception class MyException using the extends keyword.
 * Write a constructor for this class that takes a String argument and stores it inside the object with a String reference.
 * Write a method that prints out the stored string.
 * Add to method main() a try-catch clause to exercise your new exception.
 *
 * 2) Write a class MyTest with a method test() that throws an exception of the MyException type. Try compiling it without
 * an exception specification to see what the compiler says.
 * Add the appropriate exception specification (throws). Try out your class and its exception inside a try-catch clause.
 * Execute the program.
 *
 * 3) Define an MyTest object reference and initialize it to null. Try to call a method through this reference.
 * Now wrap the code in a try-catch clause to catch the exception.
 * Execute the program.
