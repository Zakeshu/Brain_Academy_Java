 * Open project called  TestEnum1 (form 2-13-2 lab).
 * Rewrite MyDayOfWeek enum, add method nextDay() which return the next day of week on for given enum value.
 * For example: MyDayOfWeek.FRIDAY.nextDay() must return MyDayOfWeek.SATURDAY.
 * Add to method main() code that read string value from console (using System.in and Scanner),
 * then you must parse string value to particular enum value (using valueOf() method) and then print the name
 * of next day of week to console.
 * Execute the program.
 * Example of program output:

 * The next day of week: SATURDAY
