/**
 * Created by a.zemlyanskiy on 05.09.2016.
 * Open project called  TestGenerics2 (from 2-14-2 lab).
 * Rewrite a class MyTestMethod to add new static method “calcSum” (with two parameters: an array T[] and variable maxval of type T) that calc sum of the number of elements in an array T[] that are greater than a specified value maxval.
 * Add to method main() code that creates two array, first – array of Integer type and second – array of Double type. Fill these arrays with some random values.
 * Add code to counts the total sum of elements in each of arrays  that are greater than a specified element by invoking calcSum static method.
 * Execute the program.
 * The program output must be like next example:
 * Array values: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
 * Sum of elements that are greater than 3:
 * 39
 * Array values: [1.1,2.2,3.3,4.4,5.5,6.6,7.7,8.8,9.9]
 * Sum of elements that are greater than 3:
 * 46.2
