/**
 * Created by a.zemlyanskiy on 05.09.2016.
 * Create new project called  TestCollection2.
 * Add package “com.brainacad.oop.testcollection2”.
 * Create a class Main with a main( ) method.
 * Add to method main() code that declares “list” variable (of LinkedList type) of string objects as LinkedList<String>.
 * Write code to fill this “list” in loop with string values like: “num_” and number of current iteration (from 0 to 10).
 * But element insertion point must be generated randomly (from 0 to current collection length).
 * Add code which iterates over list and print current element value to console.
 * Execute the program.
 * The program output must be like next example:
 *      number_5
 *      number_2
 *      number_7
 *      ...
 *      number_3
