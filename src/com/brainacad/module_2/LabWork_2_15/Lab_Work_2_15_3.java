/**
 * Created by a.zemlyanskiy on 05.09.2016.
 * Create new project called  TestCollection3.
 * Add package “com.brainacad.oop.testcollection3”.
 * Create a class Main with a main( ) method.
 * Add to method main() code to create both an ArrayList and a LinkedList (of String parameter type), and fill each in loop with string values like: “num_” and number of current iteration (from 0 to 10).
 * Print each list using an ordinary Iterator, then insert one list into the other by using a ListIterator, inserting at every other location.
 * Now perform the insertion starting at the end of the first list and moving backward.
 * Write a static method “printElements” that uses an Iterator to step through a Collection and print the each element value in the container.
 * Execute the program.
