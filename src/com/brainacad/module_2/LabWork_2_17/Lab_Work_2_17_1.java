/**
 * Created by a.zemlyanskiy on 05.09.2016.
 * Create new project called  TestThread1.
 * Add package “com.brainacad.oop.testthread1”.
 * In this exercise, you will create a simple counting thread. It will count to 10, pausing
 * one second between each number. Also, in keeping with the counting theme, it will
 * output a string every ten numbers.
 * 1. Create a class MyTimeBomb which extends the Thread class.
 * 2. Override the run()  method of Thread. This is where the code will go that
 * will output to console the numbers  from 10 to 0 and after that prints “Boom!!!” .
 * 4. Use the static method Thread.sleep()  to pause for one second.
 * (Remember, the one-arg version of sleep()  specifies the amount of time of sleep in milliseconds.)
 * Create a class Main with a main( ) method.
 * Add to method main() code that declares local variable “bomb1” of MyTimeBomb  type, and create instance of  MyTimeBomb. Add code to invoke start() method.
 * Execute the program.
 * The program output must be like next example:
 * 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 Boom!!!
