/**
 * Created by a.zemlyanskiy on 05.09.2016.
 * Create new project called  TestConcurrentCollection.
 * Add package “com.brainacad.oop.testconcoll1”.
 * Write a	program where	multiple threads read and write to a Map data structure	 (e.g. ConcurrentHashMap) using java.util.concurrent framework.  Write the same program, but now using HashMap and “synchronized” instead	of the concurrent framework. Play with the number of threads (readers and writers) and note differences in the performances.
 * Execute the program several times.
