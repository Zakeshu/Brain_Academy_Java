/**
 * Created by a.zemlyanskiy on 05.09.2016.
 * Write a program that computes the distance an object will fall in Earth's gravity.
 * Create a new class called GravityCalculator with method calcDist(double t) that takes double  t, and returns the the position of an object after falling for t seconds (outputting the position in meters).
 * The formula in Math notation is:
 * x(t) = 0.5 Ã— at 2 + vit + xi
 * Where:
 * a - Acceleration (m/s 2 ) =-9.81
 * t - Time (s) (for example t=10)
 * vi Initial velocity (m/s) =0
 * xi Initial position =0
 * Declare Acceleration value field as a constant;
