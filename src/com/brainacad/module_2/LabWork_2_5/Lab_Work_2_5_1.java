/**
 * Created by a.zemlyanskiy on 05.09.2016.
 * Create class “MyInitTest” with two initialization blocks, two static initialization blocks and two constructors (one constructor() must invoke second constructor(int)).
 * On each block write code that prints on console type of block and block number.
 * For example:
 *      “static initialization block 1”
 *      “static initialization block 2”
 *      “non-static initialization block 1”
 *      “non-static initialization block 2”
 *      “constructor 1”
 *      “constructor 2”
 *
 *  Create class Main, which will create instance of class MyInitTest by invoking first constructor.
