/**
 * Created by a.zemlyanskiy on 05.09.2016.
 * Create class “MyInit” with field “arr”of array of integers and non-static initialization block which will initialize that array with random values. (Size of array is 10)
 * To generate random numbers you can use next code:
 * arr[i]= (int) (100 * Math.random()).
 * (Or using Random class instance and nextInt() method invocation).
 * Add to class MyInit and method “printArray()” which will print values of this array.
 * Create class Main, which will create two instances of class MyInit and invoke method “printArray()” to print values of their arrays on console.
 *
 * Example of output:
 * 23,43,11,34,78,59,34,61,24,2
 * 5,48,50,3,1,4,67,62,78,98
