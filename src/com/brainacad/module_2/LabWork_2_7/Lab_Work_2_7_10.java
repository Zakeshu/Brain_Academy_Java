/**
 * Created by a.zemlyanskiy on 05.09.2016.
 * Use “MyShapes” project. The program must demonstrate the creation of an array of different types of shapes and print characteristics of each shape on console.
 * 1. Add new code to method main() in class Main:
 * 2. Create array (Shape[] arr) of different Shapes objects, (five  rectangles, two circles and two triangles);
 * 3. Add code to iterate over shapes array in loop (use for-each loop) and print characteristics of each shape on console (using “toString()” method) with area of this shape (using “calcArea()” method).
 * 4. Execute the program, output must looks like:
 *
 * This is Rectangle, color: RED, width=11, height=22,  area is: 242
 * This is Triangle, color: BLACK, a=5, b=5, c=5, area is: 10.825
 *  This is Circle, color: GREEN, radius=10, area is: 314.15926
 *
 * 5. Add code to calculate total area of all shape types. Define “sumArea” (of double type) local variable and
 * use it in loop to sum total area for all shapes.
 * 6. Add code to sum total area for each shape types. Define “sumRectArea”, “sumTriangleArea”, “sumCircleArea” (of double type)
 * local variables and use it in loop to sum total area for each shape type. You should use instanceof keyword for determining,
 * total area for each of shape types (Rectangle, Circle, Triangle) and print it to console.
 * 7. Execute the program, output must looks like:
 *      Rectangles total area: 234.54
 *      Circle total area: 547.231
 *      Triangle total area: 356.56
