/**
 * Created by a.zemlyanskiy on 05.09.2016.
 * Create new project named MyShapes. Add package “com.brainacad.oop.testshapes”.
 * You should design a super class “Shape”, which defines the public method of all the shapes called calcArea (),
 * which returns the area (double type) of that particular shape.
 * (Our program uses many kinds of shapes, such as triangle, rectangle and so on.)
 * Define a Shape class as:
 *
 * public class Shape {
 *  //declare private instance variable “shapeColor” of String type
 *  // create a constructor for Shape with shapeColor parameter
 *  // Override  toString() to return the string of Shape name and color, example:
 *      “Shape, color is: RED”
 *   // All shapes must has a method called calcArea (), write public method (empty)  calcArea ­that returns double value ( 0.0 ) .
 *  }
 *
 * Create class Main with method main().
 * The program must demonstrate the creation of one Shape object and print it name and color to console. Then add code to invoke calcArea() method and print result to console.
 * Program output must looks like:
 * “This is Shape, color is: RED”
 * “Shape area is: 0”
