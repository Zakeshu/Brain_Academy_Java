/**
 * Created by a.zemlyanskiy on 05.09.2016.
 * Add to project  “MyShapes” a new class “Circle” which is a subclass of Shape.
 * Add to class Circle a private field “radius” (of double type).
 * In class Circle override  calcArea() method which must return area of circle
 * (by the formula:  area  = PI*radius^2).
 * In class Circle override the toString() method. It must return string which contain name of shape, color and radius of circle. Example:
 * “This is Circle, color: GREEN, radius=22”
 * Add to class Circle constructor with color and radius arguments.
 * Then add to class Main code to create one Circle object and print it name color, and radius to console. Then invoke calcArea() method and print result to console.
 * Program output must looks like:
 * “This is Circle, color: GREEN, radius=10”
 * “Shape area is: 314.15926”
