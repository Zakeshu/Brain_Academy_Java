/**
 * Created by a.zemlyanskiy on 05.09.2016.
 * Add to project  “MyShapes” a new class “Rectangle” which is a subclass of Shape.
 * Add to class Rectangle a private field’s width and height (of double type).
 * In class Rectangle override  calcArea() method which must return area of rectangle
 * (By the formula:  area  = width* height).
 * In class Rectangle override the toString() method. It must return string which contain name of shape, color and rectangle width and height. Example:
 * “This is Rectangle, color: RED, width=11, height=22”
 * Add to class Rectangle constructor with color , width and height arguments.
 * Then add to class Main code to create one Rectangle object and print it name, color,
 * width and height to console. Then invoke calcArea() method and print result to console.
 * Program output must looks like:
 * “This is Rectangle, color: RED, width=11, height=22”
 * “Shape area is: 242”
