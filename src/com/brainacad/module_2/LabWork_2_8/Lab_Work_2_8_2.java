/**
 * Created by a.zemlyanskiy on 05.09.2016.
 * Add to project  “MyShapes” a new  interface called “Drawable”, with abstract method draw().
 * The draw() method has no arguments and does not return a value.
 * Implement  interface Drawable to class Shape.
 * The classes that implements the Drawable interface will provide actual implementation to these abstract method witch print
 * characteristics of each shape on console (print to console information about this object from toString() and area of this shape
 * (using “calcArea()” method).
 * Add code to main() method in class Main to iterate over shapes array in loop (use for-each loop) and invoke draw() method.
 * Execute the program, output must looks like:
 *
 *      This is Rectangle, color: RED, width=11, height=22,  area is: 242
 *      This is Triangle, color: BLACK, a=5, b=5, c=5, area is: 10.825
